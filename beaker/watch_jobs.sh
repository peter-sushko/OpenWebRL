# Periodic health check for OpenWebRL Beaker jobs (driven every 15 min).
#
# Prints one line per job in outputs/rl_full/_launched/JOBS (one "<id> <label>"
# per line, '#' comments allowed), plus a line for anything that needs attention.
# Emits nothing routine unless a state changed or a job is unhealthy, so it can be
# driven from a Monitor without flooding the conversation.
#
# Detects three failure shapes, not just a non-zero exit:
#   * terminal states (failed / canceled / preempted)
#   * a crash signature in the logs while still "running"
#   * a silent hang: log has not grown since the previous check while running
#     (the B300 runs hung for 1-2h after cuda-graph capture with no output and no
#     non-zero exit, so exit codes alone miss it). STALL_CHECKS sets how many
#     frozen checks count as a hang.
